            Hello, my name is Noah Moses. I‚Äôm a singer, songwriter, and programmer, and the creator of Noah‚Äôs Art ‚Äî a living universe of characters expressed through music, story, and blockchain technology. From Feathers, the blues-wailing peacock channeling the soul of Muddy Waters and Howlin‚Äô Wolf, to Hoodlum, a rooster with a husky, poetic flow all his own ‚Äî every character carries a unique sound, message, and energy. Each song, episode, and visual element expands a world that is alive ‚Äî evolving through community, creativity, and code.

          <p>
            What began as art is becoming a protocol ‚Äî a decentralized ecosystem called Noah‚Äôs Protocol, where music, story, and technology merge. The foundation of this protocol is a new model of value called Proof of Help ‚Üí Proof of Behavior. Instead of rewarding power or capital, the network rewards service, consistency, and contribution. Those who create, secure, and uplift others in the system rise through the Guardian Network, earning reputation, influence, and lasting wealth.

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            The immediate goal is to produce high-quality albums and visual episodes for Noah‚Äôs Art ‚Äî bringing these characters and their worlds to life. The long-term mission reaches far beyond music: Noah‚Äôs Protocol is a platform for all creators, allowing musicians, writers, and builders to launch their own coins, NFTs, and digital worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are forming Noah‚Äôs Art DAO, a decentralized creative guild dedicated to building the infrastructure, content, and technology of this vision. <em>We believe the future belongs to those who help build it ‚Äî not those who wait for it. If you feel called to create, protect, or innovate ‚Äî you already belong here.</em>

          <p>
            In the mythology of Noah‚Äôs Protocol, all who enter arrive through a wormhole that finds them across multiverses ‚Äî drawn by resonance, not by chance. Future characters and collectors will appear as beings from distant galaxies, each carrying their own art, ideas, and technology.
